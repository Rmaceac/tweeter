# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The goal here was to practice front-end development skills: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Ajax, Javascript event handlers etc. The goal was to produce a single page site which doesn't require a refresh to display newly posted tweets.

Features:

- The site scales for both mobile and large displays (over 1024px width).
- A text input form for posting your own tweets.
- Animated, toggle button to hide/reveal the text input area.
- A character counter with a highly arbitrary max count of 140. Counter indicates when too many characters have been entered.
- Error messages for empty or overfull inputs.
- An animated "back-to-the-top" button in the bottom-right hand corner of the screen.
